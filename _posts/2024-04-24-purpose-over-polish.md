title: "Purpose Over Polish: Why I Ship Plain HTML"

Flashy frameworks promise the world, but **New Rip** lives by a simpler creed: **less surface, more substance**. Plain HTML loads faster, breaks less, and reminds me every byte should earn its keep.

## Three constraints I set for every side‑project

1. **Zero build step** — code should render as‑is.  
2. **One‑coffee deploy** — from edit to production before the mug runs dry.  
3. **Offline resilience** — the site should read fine from a USB stick in 2034.

If the thing you’re making can’t pass those, ask whether the gloss is worth the overhead.
