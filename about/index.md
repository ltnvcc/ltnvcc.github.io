Hello, I’m Nenad—father, SEO & data‑automation strategist, and the man behind the **New Rip** ethos.  
My days revolve around turning search data into revenue, raising two resilient kids, and choosing purposeful action over idle talk.

I've moved through a boutique cultural tour operator, a digital agency, a price‑comparison scale‑up, and now helm SEO at Triglav Insurance. Each stop added a tool to the belt: resourcefulness, stakeholder diplomacy, and an allergy to unnecessary frills.

*New Rip* is the distillation of that journey—decisive, frugal, duty‑driven. **Feel free to reach me at nenad@ltnv.eu.**
